            <h3>About Williamsburg</h3>
            <p>
              Williamsburg has long been the setting of many seminal films and
              books that represent life in Brooklyn in the 1900s. As a
              manufacturing neighborhood, the area attracted hard-working New
              Yorkers. Decades later, Williamsburg began to attract an overflow
              of artists from downtown Manhattan, and since then it has become a
              beacon of Brooklyn creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Williamsburg has become an area known for its trendsetting
              neighbors and storefronts, which has promoted Brooklyn-branded
              shops, bars, and restaurants. Bedford is the first stop off the L
              train and a central shopping hub in the neighborhood. Small
              boutiques boast Brooklyn trends for prices lower than in
              Manhattan, and antique sales and old record stores offer the
              promise of stumbling upon hidden-gems in the depths of their
              collections.
